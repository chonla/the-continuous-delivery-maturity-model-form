# The Continuous Delivery Maturity Model Assessment Form

This form is designed to help teams assess their current level of maturity in
implementing Continuous Delivery (CD) practices. By completing the assessment,
you'll gain insights into your team's strengths, areas for improvement, and
practical steps to advance your CD maturity. The results can serve as a
baseline for tracking progress and aligning future improvements with best
practices in software delivery.
